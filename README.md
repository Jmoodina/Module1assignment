## Background
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this week's Challenge, you will organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

## Word Document Report:

### Conclusion:
The majority of crowdfunding campaigns fall short of their funding goals, as indicated by a prevalence of campaigns in the "failed" category.
The average donation per backer varies across projects and may influence overall campaign success.
Campaign outcomes exhibit patterns based on launch dates, suggesting that timing plays a crucial role in crowdfunding success.
Limitations:

The dataset's educational origin may not fully represent real-world crowdfunding dynamics.
Limited information on campaign marketing strategies and external economic factors may impact the analysis.
The dataset's time frame and size could influence the generalizability of conclusions.

### Tables and Graphs:
Geographic Analysis Table: Analyze campaign outcomes based on the country of origin.
Campaign Duration Graph: Investigate the correlation between campaign duration and success.
Reward Tiers Analysis: Explore the impact of different reward tiers on campaign success.
